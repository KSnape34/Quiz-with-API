# Quiz App using API (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

This app utilises an API to supply questions and answers so there is no time consuming manually adding questions and answers. The user can also select difficulty, category and number of questions. The system is also programmed to add points to the score depending on the time the question is answered.
**API links can be found in the Javascript code and from the website link:[Opentdb](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
